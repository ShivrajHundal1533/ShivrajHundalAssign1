#PickACard

PickACard is a project containing the public classes Card and Card Trick.
Card is used to model a playing card, and has a suit and value parameter.
CardTrick is the class used to test and use the Card class to perform a card trick.

##Description

This program uses two public classes to perform a magic trick. A hand of seven cards,
which are modelled on the Card class, is drawn. The user is then asked to pick a card.
The hand of seven cards is then searched through to see if any of the cards match
the user's picked card. If the user picks the card correctly, they win the game!

##Classes
Card: used to model the cards that are in the hand of cards.

CardTrick: used to test the Card class and actually models the hand of 7 cards.
